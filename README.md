# blockbuilder-search
API endpoint and UI for blockbuilder search page

This repo is split into two main parts, the API endpoint and the search page. It is currently only really designed
to be called from within blockbuilder, in order to develop a potentially complicated feature that has new backend requirements. 

# API endpoint
This is an express endpoint which calls ElasticSearch and returns the results.

# Search page
This is a small react app using redux.
